Here, you can find my project works related to my IBM Machine Learning course:

## Exploratory Data Analysis

🎯 The project objective is to get deep insight into the dataset "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance" from the EDA.

## Regression

🎯 The project objective is to find the features that are the most important to explain total reward in a company. 

➡️ So, here we are focusing on interpretation rather than prediction.

## Classification

🎯 The project objective is to find the features that are the most important to explain employee attrition in a company. 

➡️ So, here we are more focusing on interpretation than prediction.

💡 For the HR department and senior management of the company, the benefits will be the potential elaboration of retention strategies based on the key findings of this analysis.

## Unsupervised Learning

🎯 The project objective is to use a set of clustering methods to classify stars in groups of stars with same characteristics and compare it to existing scientific groupings.  

➡️So, here we are focusing on clustering rather than dimension reduction.

## Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning

🎯 The project objective is to use a set of deep learning methods to classify correctly handwritten Japanese hiragana character.  

➡️ So, this is a classification problem on computer vision data.

## Time Series & Survival Analysis

🎯 The objective of this analysis is to use a set of time series models ➡️ to predict accurately sunspots numbers in the following years.
